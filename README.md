# GanttChartMaker-v2.0
This is my second iteration and extension of my original GanttChartMaker. As the name implies, this program makes a process scheduling Gantt Chart for the given processe (priority, burst time, and arrival time) depending on the scheduling algorithm. The application currently supports: first-come-first-server, shortest job first, priority, round robin, and longest job first. In addition, there are several toggles and configurations for each method.

As an extension, this application also computes (and shows the work) for completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time for each process.

To install and run, simply clone the repository and run the executable in the GanttChartMaker(v2.0)/bin/Release/ folder.

I used this project to help me validate and test my own understanding of scheduling algorithms.
